# apartment-map

Import your [Apartments.com](apartments.com) search to Google My Maps.

## Why?

Apartments.com provides basic search filters to help narrow down listings. However, there is no way to consider custom factors outside what the site allows. Maybe you want to look at bus routes, crime, or even noise levels.

## Demo

I pulled apartments in the Los Angeles area and displayed them alongside Metro stations:

Each location has the price range and a link back to the original listing: ![Screenshot of Google My Maps showing listing details](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11097096/118912172-5ce5e280-b8f5-11eb-8c85-3b13b3416b71.png)

If you want to add accurate commute estimates, use `directions.py` to modify your `apartments.tsv` file: ![Screenshot of Google My Maps showing listing details with distance and bus fare](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11097096/118912388-bbab5c00-b8f5-11eb-8917-15928f0d1387.png)


## Instructions

1. Do your search on [apartments.com](https://apartments.com)
1. Right click on the page and hit "Inspect Element". In Chrome, this is just "Inspect".
    * Beware that this changes the size of the map and the results may change.
1. Go to the tab that says "Console".
1. Copy and paste [apartments.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sameer/apartment-map/main/apartments.js) into the console. When it's done, the page will offer to save an `apartments.tsv` file. Download that.
    * You may receive a warning about only pasting code you trust. Bypass that. If you have any concerns, feel free to read the code ðŸ™‚
1. Upload it to Google My Maps.
1. Pick address for the positioning column.
